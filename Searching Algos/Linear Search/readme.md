Linear Search is checking every element in the array one by one to search the element.

The use case of the linear search algorithm is found in the functions indexOf(), includes(), find(), findIndex()

Pseudocode for linear search for finding the index of a given element in an array: 

1. The function accepts an array and a value.
2. Loop through the arrray and check whether the element is equal to any other element in the array.
3. If it is, then return the index at which the element is found.
4. If the value is never found, return -1.
