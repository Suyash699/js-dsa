Frequency counter uses object and set to collect values or frequency of values. 
It is useful in the algorithms where there are multiple pieces of data and you have to compare to see if they are anagram
Basically any time values are compared to each other with 2 or more inputs and frequencies of the value to occur 

Time Complexity of freqcounter = O(n)
