Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm where the larger values bubble to the top.

Pseudocode:
1. Compare 2 elements.
2. Swap both the elements if the first element is greater than the 2nd & continue the same till the last element.
3. Repeat the process till the array is sorted.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
