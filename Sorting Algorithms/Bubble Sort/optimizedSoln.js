//The problem with naive is that it keeps comparing even if the array is sorted as long as the end is not reached in the loop so we add a noSwaps variable after the i loop & set its value as true inside the j loop in if condition i.e., if the swap is made, set noSwaps as false and at the end of j loop if noSwaps is true, break.
